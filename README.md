> [!IMPORTANT] 
> > texture file format: converting PNG files into an appropriate file formats such as TIFF, EXR and considering mip-mapping if available.
> > > 3d file format: favoring Alembic (.abc) and USD file formats over inappropriate, poorly optimized and archaic (obsolete) formats, i.e. FBX, OBJ).
> > > >mesh optimization: optimizing messy 3d files: proper naming convention, group and sub-groups (“parenting”), etc.
